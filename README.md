## Why Web Scraping is Useful?
Web scraping helps in extracting valuable information from websites, allowing businesses and researchers to analyze trends, track product prices, and gather user sentiment from customer reviews. This project demonstrates how to efficiently collect structured data from Amazon for further processing.

### Ethical Considerations
When scraping websites, it is essential to follow ethical guidelines:
- **Respect Robots.txt**: Always check if a website allows web scraping.
- **Avoid Overloading Servers**: Use request delays to prevent excessive load on Amazon's servers.
- **Use Data Responsibly**: Scraped data should not be used for malicious purposes or commercial exploitation.
- **Acknowledge Data Ownership**: The information belongs to Amazon and its users, and should be used ethically.
