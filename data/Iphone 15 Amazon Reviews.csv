Stunning Pink ‚Äì A Perfect Blend of Beauty & Performance
","
I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention‚Äîit looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.

iPhone 15 A solid upgrade and value for money
","
DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14. DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge.  Overall  The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.ProsNew design with rounded edgesMore powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 proNew 48-megapixel main cameraBrighter display with upto 2000 nits brightnessUSB C can be used for anythingDynamic IslandCons No 120hz display No Macro photography

iPhone XR to iPhone 15
","
Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase .

The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use
","
The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.
